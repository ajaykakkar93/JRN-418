Create a data memo for your beat
========================================================

**Due by next class**

Write me draft paper that describes the kinds of data that exists on the beat you want to focus on:

* That you know exist
* That you hope to find
* Or that you will collect yourself

Create a data memo for your beat
========================================================

Regarding the data you're envisioning, answer

* Why this data source is interesting and what youâ€™re curious about.
* Where this data exists, or where you expect to find it
* Anticipated problems in collecting or analyzing it

This is just brainstorming and you don't have to commit to what you come up with for the homework for your midterm or final project. 

This will hopefully set you on the path toward thinking of data as soon as possible. I will give feedback and help you refine researching possibilities.
