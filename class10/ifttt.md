title: Gathering data by using IFTTT

Want to track new postings on Craigslist for a specific search? Use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/recipes) (IfThisThenThat).

People make "recipes" on the site combining triggers like text messages, Google Alerts, FourSquare checkins, and programs a reaction with another service, like Dropbox or Twitter.

For this example, I want to track the prices of Red Sox tickets on Craigslist. Copy the URL the search generated.

Visit [this link](https://ifttt.com/recipes/54659-searching-for-what-a-craigslist-spreadsheet) and give IFTTT permission to access your Google Drive account.

and paste the copied URL into the appropriate data field.

All new updates to that search will be sent to a spreadsheet in your Google Drive.

You're all set. The data comes in dirty but there are ways to clean it up.

(Hint: Use Text to Columns in Excel to split off the prices listed)
