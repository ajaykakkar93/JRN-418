##### Course Objective: 

There more charts, maps, and interactives on news sites [than ever before](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/03/16/data-journalism-on-the-rise/6424671/). But data-driven news stories and graphics have been moving readers, impacting communities, and changing lives for hundreds of years.

According to the undergraduate catalog, this course is *Data Visualization*, but it's much more than that.

This course is about *Data Journalism.* Data and Journalism. Observations and stories. This class will be both technical and philosophical.

Students will learn to apply the process of a [data scientist](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-work-flow-or-process-of-a-data-scientist) to journalism.

Data is just another source for reporters to research, interview, and glean answers from. Students will be introduced to communicating stories through visualizations like charts and maps. But more importantly, this course will also build on the skills necessary to find and tell stories using data and the knowledge required to understand the data itself.

&nbsp; 

##### Readings:

No textbooks. We will have weekly readings chosen from news stories both recent and historical, research documents, government PDFs, Storifies, and many others. Students will be expected to discuss these readings in class.

Be prepared to talk about the following things related to the readings at class:

- What data set or key idea is used to base the reading?
- Is there anything you disagree with?
- How was the data collected?
- Was that process infallible? innovative?
- What could improve on the data or the story?
- Are there other angles the writer could have approached the data or the story?


&nbsp; 

##### Class structure:

The three-hour class will be split between dicussion or lectures and hands-on workshops.  

&nbsp; 

##### Grading:

Each student’s final grade will be determined by five factors described below. While I will communicate any concerns that I have about individual performance, please do not hesitate to contact me with questions about grading or general performance.

&nbsp; 

##### In-class and homework assignments:

Students will be required to complete exercises both during class and outside of class. Late work will be penalized on a sliding scale (the later the assignment, the larger the penalty). A good rule: don’t come to class empty-handed – at the very least, show me that you attempted the assignment. Together these assignments constitute 25 percent of each student’s grade.

&nbsp; 

##### Deadlines:

In a newsroom, meeting deadlines are crucial. 
Answers to the assignments will be discussed in class. Therefore, late assignments will automatically receive zero points. Non-working versions will also be considered late. Turn in homework by the deadline, even if your'e unsure of some of the answers. 

&nbsp; 

##### Attendance and participation:

Attendance will be taken as seriously as deadlines. 

We are going to cover a lot of ground during this course. Each class and homework assignment depends on picking up and understanding what was taught during the previous class. 

&nbsp; 

#### Grading:

- Participation: 20%
- Homework assignments: 25%
- Mid-term data analysis project: 25%
- Final data story project: 30%

###### Mid-term:

Obtain and analyze federal government data and write a summary of the analysis. Not the actual story. Instead, the memo should detail the process it will take to get to the final story or visualization. Explain what it took to get the data, who explained it to you, point out the nuances and limitations of it and how it was collected or processed. Discuss the gaps in tha data and what could be improved. Then, analyze the agency that provided the data set. Detail the scope, quality, and accesibility of the rest of the department's data. How journalists might have used it so far or how it could be used in the future.

###### Final:

Each student will be responsible for obtaining, analyzing and visualizing a federal government data set assigned to him/her, using methods learned in class. 

The breakdown for the final grade will be:

- Pitch (25 percent)
- Storyboard (12.5 percent)
- Draft (25 percent)
- Final (25 percent)
- Revisioni (12.5 percent
