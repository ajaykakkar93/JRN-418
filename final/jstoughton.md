**Redo this map using the per capita (deaths per 1,000 residents( figures I mentioned in the email**


*By Jacqueline Stoughton*

Drugs of choice are no longer uppers including cocaine, but rather downer drugs - particularly opioid pills and heroin - are making a lethal comeback among young adults in suburban Connecticut communities.

The increase in heroin and opioid pain pill addictions, which is responsible for claiming the lives of 44,000 each year throughout the United States - this exceeds the death toll during the peek of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1990s, according to [Vox](http://www.linkgoeshere.com). **<- Insert link to story** 

This increased addiction to opioids has become a public health crisis and an official epidemic in Connecticut, as announced by Gov. Dannel Malloy. In July 2015, Gov. Malloy [signed a bill](http://www.linkgoeshere.com). **<- Insert link to story** meant to assist in curbing substance abuse and opioid overdoses.

According to the data, Hartford, Waterbury, New Haven, Bridgeport and Norwich are the top five most common towns in Connecticut where overdoses from both heroin and opioid pain pills occur. **<- These are also the towns with the highest population. This sentence is fine to keep in here, but you also need to add a line on which towns per capita have the most overdoses.**

**Map headline goes here**

**This map is missing title and legend information**

In almost all instances, this deadly addiction usually begins with a preliminary addiction to some sort of opioid pain pill; such as Oxycodone, Methadone, Morphine and Fentanyl as described in the data from Data Connecticut. **<- What? Link this**

The transition from pills to heroin occurs for various reasons - usually due to financial reasons, accessibility or achieving a better high. More options of taking heroin, besides shooting up with a needle, make the drug more appealing to a broader rage of people. Users can now smoke it, consume it orally or snort it.

Within the past three years, Connecticut has seen a significant increase in users and deaths due to overdoses from both heroin and opioid pills.

**After you create the new chart (stacked column chart that I mentioned in the email), summarize what you see-- which towns have gone up since 2012 and which have gone down? Replace the sentence below with this analysis. And you can't say it's "expected to grow" without authority. What you have is evidence of deaths between 2012 and 2014. You can't say that it's "expected to continue to grow".**

~~In 2012, the data was average, and then experienced a large increase the following year. Each year following is expected to continue to grow as the addiction to opioid substances becomes more appealing and easier to obtain. ~~

The extreme financial cost of opioid pills, which ~~sell~~ **has sold** for a minimum of $30, can reach price tags as high as hundreds of dollars per pill; whereas heroin sells for $10 a hit, dealers tend to offer package deals, allowing the user to make their supply last longer and get the most out of what they paid for. **<- according to who? This whole sentence needs to be attributed to someone or a study. I suggest moving this below the paragraph introducing Bradley.**

Jason Bradley, 26, of Enfield has tried everything from marijuana to ecstasy to cocaine to morphine - eventually becoming hooked on percocet 30. He paid anywhere from $30-35 per pill to keep up this habit, until a friend introduced him to a cheaper alternative with the same downer effect: heroin. The high, he describes as being "pure euphoria, it's the ultimate high. I felt like superman."

“I’ve seen a lot of addicts where that addiction [to pain pills] goes to heroin because it’s cheaper,” said Diane McCabe, a nurse at Hartford Hospital who works in the faternal fetal medicine outpatient clinic for high-risk pregnancies. “Young kids are selling it on the street from wherever they can steal it from.”

McCabe explains the biggest complaint hospitals face is ~~complaints~~ from patients about inadequate pain control. In order to keep patience’s content and hospital rating up – causing the dosages to go up in order to keep a handle on patience’s pain, keeping them content with the care they’re receiving. 

Over prescription of pain medications is a major factor in the increase of opioid addiction this country is facing. According to McCabe, patients typically go home with a prescription of 30 to 50 percocets.

“I’ve been a nurse for 30 years and have seen an increase in users and an increase in the reliance on methadone,” said McCabe. “We’re abusing methadone and over prescribing on that.”

Ten milligrams a day of methadone is what’s recommended for recovering heroin addicts who are taking this supplemental opioid to assist them in not using heroin off the streets, is equivalent to using one bag of heroin a day. According to McCabe, hospitals are giving their patience’s up to 200 milligrams of methadone a day. “The thinking is we don’t want them to go out and use on the streets.”

To beat his addiction, Bradley was prescribed naltrexone, similar to methadone, which is used to help ease users off the opioid they’re addicted to when in recovery by blocking the actions of opioids. However, narcotics used with the intention to do good still end up fueling an addiction even more – keeping the addicted hooked rather than getting them off it for good.

<div style="font-size:.8em">Jason Bradley.</div></div> Bradley explained his addiction to heroin took effect immediately after the first hit, since it was now substituting for the pills. 

Eventually, the euphoric feeling drastically decreased to sickness – Bradley was now taking heroin just to feel normal and to compact the illness he felt throughout his body, then taking more to achieve a high. Bradley then found himself “speed balling,” mixing heroin with cocaine, just to feel a better high by combating the downer effects of heroin with an upper drug such as cocaine that would provide him with more energy will on a high.

Over $1,000 spent and one year later, Bradley’s family intervened with an intervention and sent him to a rehab facility in Florida – he has been sober without release following a year out of rehab.

“I tried to quit a couple times pre-intervention using solvation at least three times to get off [heroin] but then something happens that you get back on it,” said Bradley, he explained regularly attending therapy session helped with the underlying issues that caused his addictions. “My biggest regrets are hurting my family, the lost time and money and the damage caused to my body. It [addiction] made me who I am today and made my relationships stronger.”
