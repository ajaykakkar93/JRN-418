Drugs of choice are no longer uppers including cocaine, but rather downer drugs - particuarily opioid pills and heroin - are making a lethal comeback among young adults in suberban Connecticut communities.

The increase in heroin and opoioid pain pill addictions, which is respobsible for claiming the lives of 44,ooo each year throughout the United States - this exceeds the death toll during the peek of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1990s, according to Vox. This increased addiction to opoioids has become a public health crisis and an official epidemic in Connecticut, as announced by Gov. Danel Malloy. In July 2015, Gov. Malloy signed a bill meant to assist in curbing substance abuse and opioid overdoses.

According to the data, Hartford and Waterbury are the two most common towns where overdoses from heroin occur. In almost all instances, this deadly addiction usually begins with a preliminary addiction to some sort of opioid pain pill; such as oxycodine, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, fentanyl, among many others. The transition from pills to heroin occurs for various reasons - usually due to financial reasons, accessibility or achieving a better high. More options of taking heroin, beside shooting up with a needle, make the drug more appealing to a broader rage of people. Users can now smoke it, consume it orally or snort it.

The extreme financial cost of opioid pills, which sell for a minimum of $30, can reach price tags as high as hundreds of dollars per pill; whereas heroin sells for $10 a hit, dealers tend to offer package deals, allowing the user to make their supply last longer and get the most out of what they paid for.

Jason Bradley of Enfield, has tried everything from marajuania to ecstacy to cocaine to morphine - eventually becoming hooked on percaset 30. He paid anywhere from $30-35 per pill to keep up this habbit, until a friend introduced him to a cheaper alternative with the same downer effect: heroin. The high, he describes as being "pure euphoria, it's the ultimate high. I felt like superman."
