title: Majority of a Youth in Detention Centers Held on Charges of Drug Use 
---

*By Ruth Bruno*

Since Governor Dannell Malloy first introduced his plan for a ‘second chance society’, the movement to decrease the lengths of prison sentences for youths held on drug-related charges has been gaining momentum among state representatives and senators.  

“We incarcerate the population way too often for a problem that should be addressed by offering aid for an addiction,” said State Representative Matthew Ritter who has been a supporter of Malloy’s plans and legislative actions to decrease the sentencing for youth who have been arrested.

“Staying in jail for three years instead of getting help just means our incarcerated population is increasing.”

Data released by the state of Connecticut show that a majority of incarcerated youth are being detained for drug-related charges while more serious charges such as violent crime are in the minority.

The hefty price of incarceration is increasingly becoming a concern for taxpayers. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, people who have been arrested for drug use make up 48.7 percent of the U.S. prison population. 

The National Association of State Budget Officers reports that taxpayers spend an average total of $50 billion annually for state prisons.~~, and a study conducted by the VERA Institute of Justice in 2012 indicated that~~ 

Connecticut spent an average of $50,262 annually per incarcerated citizen — the third highest average of the 40 states that participated in a study from the VERA Institute of Justice in 2012.~~the study.~~.

“I think people are beginning to realize how expensive it is to put juveniles away into detention centers,” said Ritter.

Connecticut is not the only state looking to minimize penalties for people who have used drugs. 11 states, including New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Delaware, have repealed or shortened the mandatory sentence for non-violent residents arrested for drug possession. 63 percent of Americans polled in 2014 favored these changes in state drug laws, while 32 percent opposed repeals.

“We are beginning to see that these ‘get tough on crime initiatives introduced in the ‘80’s haven’t been working, to continue the same approach would be a bad idea, continued Ritter.”

Senator Gary Winfield argues that this type of “harsh” treatment towards drug use only contributes to the problem. “We don’t want the people who have served their time and redeemed themselves to be stuck unable to be employed. That only leads them right back into the system,” said Winfield.

For Andre Trevlante “the system” is an all too familiar story. Trevelante, 22 says he was arrested at the age of 17 on charges of possession of cocaine and drug paraphernalia.
Trevlante says he was sent to Cheshire Correctional Facility for 2 years following his arrest. 

“I wasn’t in the best situation, most of my friends weren’t either. So I mean this was a way out for us – the drugs were, for a little while anyway.”

Trevlante’s problems only multiplied, however, when he was released from the correctional facility and faced with the task of finding employment.  But Trevlante feels that having to check the “yes” box under the criminal record section on a job application has threatened his chances of finding steady work.

“Just being in there for that period of time, I feel like, has ruined my chances of finding a good job. I can’t find anything. I’m hoping to just find work so I can get started at a college. I’m trying to leave the past in the past, but that’s not happening right now.”
