title: Student parking drastically lower at CCSU
---

*By Larry Clark*

Parking has always been a heated debate at Central Connecticut State University. The administration has been adamant that there is not a parking issue on campus, while many commuter students say that they can not find the parking that they need. 

At the beginning of the past two years the CCSU Police Department has tracked parking data. 

Overall the data shows that Monday morning had the least amount of parking space available and Friday had the most open parking spaces.

The data follows the general trend of the most spaces having been available in the before or at 9 a.m. and after or at 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, which lines up with the current break down of when classes are offered. 

Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. are when the main block of classes are. 

There is then a University Hour from 3:05 p.m. to 4:20 p.m. This would line up with the spikes that happen around 5 p.m. at these times. 

While CCSU does offer classes on Friday, students can arrange their schedules to avoid it, which is beneficial for a campus of 8,000 commuter undergraduate students. This is reflected in the large amount of open spaces even at mid-day (typically the lowest point) on Friday.

However, with the lowest dip in available parking being at 207 and the more frequent dips being between 300 and 400 it is hard to understand why many students at CCSU are saying that they can not find parking spaces, it is taking them too long to park, and are late to class because of parking. 

When faculty-only parking lots are removed and the data is reexamined and represented, the numbers look drastically different.

Upon removing all the faculty lots (including Manafort) the numbers drastically decrease, especially the dips which are all under 250 open spots. The peaks on the other hand ranged from 1118 open spots to 744 From Monday to Thursday.

When doing this, the total number of parking spots decreased by 909 spots but the peaks only dropped by approximately 300 spots. This shows that there are approximately 600 open parking spots are across faculty lots. 

The data was originally presented in the form of percent of parking spaces filled. 

"The police know how many spots are in each spot and each floor of a parking garage. Using this information they know about how full the lots are," said Richard Bachoo the Chief Administrative Officer for CCSU. 

This method for data collection is nowhere near as reliable as actually counting space each and every time, however it is the data that the University uses to make decisions.

There was also a Central Connecticut Regional Planning Agency study that examined transportation in 2013. Part of the transportation study was also a parking study. 

This study not only surveyed students but did parking audits as well. It noted that many students spent much of their time circling parking lots and garages. 

The one problem with this study is that it clearly didn't assess just student parking. CCRPA often states that they found about 1000 open parking spaces, however this does not mark in its averages the differences between student and faculty parking.

This study did however find that, “a two-tiered parking pass system would reduce parking congestion while maintaining parking choice. Students would be separated into two groups and given two different parking passes. One pass would be restricted to Copernicus and Kaiser while the other would be unrestricted.”

The CCRPA study also found that charging visitors to park would be another potential way to control and direct parking around campus. Charging visitors to park would also have the added benefit of increasing revenue for the campus.
