### Storyboard due Nov. 18

You should already have the data sets you are going to be analyzing

* Tell me how you expect to transform the data you have into the visualizations you envision.
* List the visualizations you are going to make.
* Literally sketch the maps or charts or whatever out on a piece of paper or napkin, take a photo of each one, and send them to me.
