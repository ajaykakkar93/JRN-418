#### Quick exercise

[Faculty & Staff Directory](http://www.ccsu.edu/index/directory.html)

* Search for [the professors](http://www.ccsu.edu/index/directory.html) listed in the Journalism department. 
* Check the university profile pages (shows up as **website** under their names) if they exist. 
* Put together a spreadsheet of their information modeled in a way that information about other professors from other departments could be added later.
* Narrow it down to the common types of information about them. 
* If some professors do not have the same information listed, but you think the category is important, leave the cell blank.
* The goal is to structure the spreadsheet in a way for analysis later on.
* Upload the spreadsheet with the structured professor information to your Github repo.

#### Exercise 1

Critique a piece of data journalism
Due by next class
Find a story that purports to use data, read it, and answer the following questions:

What are the datasets used here, and where did they come from?
What is the “birth story” of the data, e.g. how were they created in the first place?
What claims does the story make based on the data?
What are the limitations of the data?
Can you find where this (original) data exists online? If so, post the relevant URLs. Write this memo in Markdown format and post it to your private Github repo. If this hasn’t been set up for you, then just email it to me.
Here’s an example memo. View it raw on Github to see the actual Markdown.

Here are examples of data-based stories that you can use for this assignment if you don’t want to look for your own:
