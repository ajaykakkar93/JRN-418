- EXPLAINER ON MIDTERM


A special note about data cleaning: This week's lessons will probably drive you crazy. It's more important than ever to think: Why am I doing this? What problem am I trying to solve? What is the kind of thing that I'm trying to understand?

Don't get too involved in seeing things as an arbitrary mix of tools and techniques to memorize, or you're going to want to quit civilized life to live in the mountains.
