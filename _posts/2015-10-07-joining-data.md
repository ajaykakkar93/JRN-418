### Homework 2

Make me a Choropleth map in Google Fusion Table based on the data on US Mass Shootings. 

* You'll have to split out the state names
* Pivot table based on the count by state
* Adjust the number to normalize for population using **state population** statistics
* Download the kml file for all the states
* Bring both files into Google Tables
* Merge the normalized shootings data to the boundaries file
* Map it out, add a legend

Embed it on a page and publish it to your **github.io** page. Email me the link.
