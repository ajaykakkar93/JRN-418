## Final story due Dec. 9

I will send you your drafts back to you by Saturday morning with edits.

The revisions will be due Wednesday, December 9 before 2 p.m.

### Tutorials for today's class

* [Highcharts.JS walkthrough]({{ site.url }}/class13/highcharts)
* [Converting data to JSON format]({{ site.url }}/class13/json_convert)
* [Making D3 charts using D3Plus.js]({{ site.url }}/class14/d3plus)
* [Leaflet map walkthrough]({{ site.url }}/class13/leafletjs)

### Batch Geocoding options
* [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/)
  * CartoDB will automatically look up latitude and longitude for addresses but won't let you export it easily (They want you to stay within their environment)
  * But you can still get the data by selecting all the data in the table (CTRL+A or CMD+A) and copy and paste it into a new spreadsheet
* [Texas A&M Geocoder - Free online geocoding](http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/)
  * Email them a list of addresses and they'll email back latitudes and longitudes
* [BatchGeo](http://batchgeo.com/)
  * Only 250 free lookups a day
* [Geocodio](http://geocod.io/)
  * 100 free lookups a day (or 2,500 if you register)
* [Batch Geocode](http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/batch-geocode/)
  * No limit, but lags after 300 lookups
  * Someone's running it himself. So who knows how long it will last?
