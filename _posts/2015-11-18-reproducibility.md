### Draft for final story due Dec. 2

**This is the big one.**

You'll have two weeks to write it and make the visualizations.

It needs to be written in the format of a Jekyll markdown page.

Email it to me as `your_name.md`.

It's due by 2 p.m. on Dec. 2.

If you are running into problems or have any questions, e-mail me and I'll help you through.
